			<Description>
				Abstract Web services frequently provide
				business–critical functionality
				over the Internet,
				being widely exposed
				and thus representing an attractive target for
				security attacks. In
				particular, Denial of Service (DoS) attacks may inflict severe damage
				to web
				service
				providers, including financial and reputation losses.
				This way, it is vital
				that the software
				supporting services deployment
				(ie, the web service framework) is able to
				provide a secure
				environment, so that the services can be delivered even when facing
				attacks. In
				this paper, ...

			<Description>
				Abstract—Testing Web Services (WS) for robustness is a
				lengthy and arduous process.
				After testing a set of services, there is
				typically a very large
				quantity and variety of test results to be
				analyzed, which poses a
				challenge to the developer that has to
				manually process all results
				and identify the outputs that indicate
				the presence of bugs in the
				code. Previous research indicates that
				well-known automatic
				classification algorithms can be used to automate
				this step.
				However, the applicability of such algorithms is also
				limited, as
				they are frequently ...
