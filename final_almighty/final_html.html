<td>Robustness-Driven Resilience Evaluation of Self-Adaptive Software Systems</td><td>Javier C&aacute;mara, Rog&eacute;rio de Lemos, Nuno Laranjeiro, Rafael Ventura, Marco Vieira</td><td>2015/5/4</td><td>Abstract&mdash;An increasingly important requirement for certain classes of software-intensive systems is the ability to self-adapt their structure and behavior at run-time when reacting to changes that may occur to the system, its environment, or its goals. A major challenge related to self-adaptive software systems is the ability to provide assurances of their resilience when facing changes. Since in these systems, the components that act as controllers of a target system incorporate highly complex software, there is the need to ...</td><td>1</td>

In this context, web service frameworks play a key role as intermediate layers, offering support for interoperability and communication between providers and consumers. Due to their relevance in the overall infrastructure, frameworks are a frequent target of attacks trying to impact the performance of the provided services. This paper proposes an experimental approach for assessing the performance of web ...</td><td>1</td>

Controllers are complex components incorporated in self-adaptive systems, which are crucial to their function since they are in charge of adapting the target system by executing actions through effectors, based on information monitored by probes.

<td>A technique for deploying robust web services</td><td>Nuno Laranjeiro, Marco Vieira, Henrique Madeira</td><td>2014/1</td><td>Abstract&mdash;Developing robust web services is a difficult task. Field studies show that a large number of web services are deployed with robustness problems (ie, presenting unexpected behaviors in the presence of invalid inputs). Although several techniques for the identification of robustness problems have been proposed in the past, there is no practical approach to automatically fix those problems. This paper proposes a mechanism that automatically fixes robustness problems in web services. The approach consists of using ...</td><td>6</td>

<td>Towards evaluating the impact of data quality on service applications</td><td>Naghmeh Ivaki, Nuno Laranjeiro, Marco Vieira</td><td>2013/6/24</td><td>Abstract&mdash;Service applications frequently make use of a relational database to store and retrieve data and rely on the correctness of this data to deliver service to clients. Despite this, relational databases do not provide support for complex data integrity restrictions, which have to be controlled by the application. As such, bugs present in service applications can easily lead to the storage of incorrect data that, at random instants can cause applications to fail and stop delivering service, which can severely impact clients, other applications, and ...</td><td>1</td>

The tool implements a large set of attack types, defined based on previous security research studies, existing testing tools, and field experience. The motivation is that developers frequently build web services based on the assumption that the underlying frameworks are secure, which is not always the case. Despite the evident need for security in the platforms that support services, existing security testing tools are very limited. In practice, most tools ...</td><td>4</td>

In a Web services environment, providers supply a set of services for consumers. However, although Web services are being used in business-critical environments, there are no practical means to test or compare their robustness to invalid and malicious inputs. In fact, client applications are typically developed with the assumption that the services being used are robust, which is not always the case. Robustness failures in such environments are particularly dangerous ...</td><td>3</td>

<td>A Composed Approach for Automatic Classification of Web Services Robustness</td><td>Rui Oliveira, Nuno Laranjeiro, Marco Vieira</td><td>2011/7/4</td><td>Abstract&mdash;Testing Web Services (WS) for robustness is a lengthy and arduous process. After testing a set of services, there is typically a very large quantity and variety of test results to be analyzed, which poses a challenge to the developer that has to manually process all results and identify the outputs that indicate the presence of bugs in the code. Previous research indicates that well-known automatic classification algorithms can be used to automate this step. However, the applicability of such algorithms is also limited, as they are frequently ...</td><td>2</td>

Robustness testing is an approach particularly suitable for detecting robustness issues in web services. In fact, several research works have been conducted in the past leading to the proposal of different robustness testing techniques for such environments. However, although of utmost importance, most techniques do not consider the needs of complex systems and services as the ones being developed by the ...</td><td>1</td>

However, when executing robustness tests, a very large amount of service responses has to be manually classified to distinguish regular responses from responses that indicate robustness problems. Besides requiring a large amount of time and effort, this complex classification process can easily lead to errors resulting from the human intervention in such a laborious task. Text classification algorithms have been applied successfully in many ...</td><td>11</td>
